          <p>The process of creating concept art begins with brainstorming and ideation. This stage allows artists to freely explore ideas without restrictions, generating a pool of creative concepts that can later be refined. Brainstorming often involves mind-mapping, thumbnail sketches, and collaborative discussions with team members to align artistic direction with the project's needs. Ideation is where the artist begins to channel imagination into tangible forms.</p>

            <p>Research and inspiration follow, as no idea exists in isolation. Concept artists immerse themselves in references, studying real-world elements such as cultural motifs, architectural styles, natural environments, or historical periods. Research ensures that the designs feel authentic and grounded (to our world and the world a character is within) while remaining imaginative. Inspiration can also come from other media, such as literature, film, or fine art, to help in building a visual library that later informs the work.</p>

            <img src="Images/sketch.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image">
            <p>The final step in the workflow involves initial sketches and thumbnails, where ideas begin to take shape visually. These early drafts are often rough, focusing on layout, silhouette, and composition rather than fine details. From here, iterative design refines the initial concepts, leading to polished artwork that reflects the intended vision. This structured process allows concept art to evolve from a vague idea into a compelling visual narrative.</p>
