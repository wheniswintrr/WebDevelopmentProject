            <p>Hi, I'm Hayden! I'm a content creator and artist under the handle NightForHail.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed browsing through my website, I created this site with the intention of commemorating and celebrating the beauty of concept art, as well as compiling and demonstrations of important skills and techniques as shown with the many wonderful pieces and studies I have attatched throughout this page. I do hope that this could have been of use to you, as much as making this website has been to me. Credits to respective artists for each included piece have been attatched in captions, and all left without a caption were done by myself.</p>
            <p>If you are still looking for more resources, I have attached a few videos below that may peak your interest, if you wish to continue developing your knowledge on concept art.</p>
            <p>Again, thank you for visiting and I hope that this could be helpful, or at the very least, an enjoyable read!</p>
