          <p>Concept art is a field where both traditional and digital tools play significant roles. Traditional tools, such as pencils, markers, and paints, are indispensable for capturing raw ideas quickly and intuitively. Many artists prefer the tactile feel of these tools when creating loose sketches or exploring color schemes. Watercolors and gouache are also favored for their ability to produce organic textures and dynamic hues.</p>
