          <p>Concept art encompasses a wide range of styles, from the highly stylized to the hyper-realistic. Stylized art emphasizes exaggerated proportions, bold colors, and unique shapes, creating a more whimsical or exaggerated tone. On the other hand, realistic styles focus on accuracy in anatomy, lighting, and texture to create believability. The choice of style is often dictated by the narrative and mood of the project.</p>

            <p>Many artists find success by blending elements of both styles. For instance, an environment might be painted with realistic textures but arranged in a surreal composition. Characters could have exaggerated features but still follow natural anatomical rules. This hybrid approach allows for creative freedom while maintaining a sense of believability, a key factor in concept art for video games and films.</p>

            <p>The right style often depends on the project’s genre and audience. For a whimsical fantasy world, a more stylized approach may resonate better with the target audience, while a sci-fi epic might demand a more realistic style to convey the advanced technology and alien environments. The art style also informs the tone, whether lighthearted, gritty, or mysterious.</p>
