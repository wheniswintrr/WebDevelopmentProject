            <h1>Origins of Concept Art
            </h1>
            <p>Concept art has been a career for nearly 100 years. The term was first notably used in the 1930’s by the Walt Disney Animation Studio. Some of the most pivotal and influential animations of the time exist greatly thanks to the influence of concept artists. Movies like Snow White, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Peter Pan and many other Disney films of the time can be accredited to talented concept artists, such as Albert Hurter and Ferdinand Horvath.</p>

    <h2>The Purpose</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of concept art is to create a visual representation for ideas, characters, environments, or objects that do not yet exist. These visuals serve as a critical guide during the production process, ensuring that the final product aligns with the story’s narrative and themes.</p>
    <p>This is done in a number of ways, namely:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visualizing Ideas: Taking abstract ideas and assigning them to tangible and clairvoyant visuals.</li>
        <li>Establishing Tone and Style: Setting the mood, aesthetic, and thematic direction of a project.</li>
        <li>Facilitating Collaboration: Acting as a reference point for teams artists, designers, and directors, to foster a more cohesive final project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whether designing fantastical environments or bringing unique characters to life, concept art ensures that every visual element contributes meaningfully to the story and the overall vision.</p>
