          <p>Creating effective background art requires a strong understanding of composition and perspective. Composition dictates the arrangement of elements within the frame, guiding the viewer's eye to the focal point while maintaining balance. Techniques such as the rule of thirds and leading lines are commonly employed to create dynamic and engaging compositions. Perspective adds depth and realism, whether through one-point, two-point, or atmospheric perspective techniques.</p>

            <p>Lighting and color are equally critical in setting the mood and tone of an environment. Warm tones can evoke a sense of comfort or energy, while cool tones create calmness or tension. Lighting directs focus, highlights key elements, and adds dimensionality to the scene. Artists also use shadow to create contrast and texture, enhancing the believability of their work.</p>

            <span class="caption">Makeup2 by WLOP.</span>
            <p>Backgrounds tell stories through details. Including objects like worn furniture, overgrown plants, or scattered artifacts can hint at the history, culture, or events that shaped the environment. These small touches anchor the world in a sense of realism while allowing viewers to connect emotionally with the setting.</p>
